                [stream_unit=2^11])

Initialize format and capacity of audio playback.

This function is called automatically (using the default settings) the first
time a `Sound` object is created (normally during [`play`](@ref) or
[`stream`](@ref)).  It need not normally be called explicitly, unless you wish
to change one of the default settings.

# Sample Rate

Sample rate determines the maximum playable frequency (max freq is â‰ˆ
sample_rate/2). Changing the sample rate from the default 44100 to a new value
will also change the default sample rate sounds will be created at, to match
this new sample rate.

# Channel Number

The number of channels determines the number of sounds and streams that can be
played concurrently. Note that discrete sounds and streams use a distinct set of
channels.

# Queue Size

Sounds can be queued to play ahead of time (using the `time` parameter of
[`play`](@ref)). When you request that a sound be played it may be queued to
play on a channel where a sound is already playing. The number of sounds that
can be queued to play at once is determined by queue size. The number of
channels times the queue size determines the number of sounds that you can queue
up to play ahead of time.

# Stream Unit

The stream unit determines the number of samples that are streamed at one time.
Iterators to be used as streams should generate this many samples at a time.  If
this value is too small for your hardware, streams will sound jumpy. However the
latency of streams will increase as the stream unit increases. Future versions
of Weber will likely improve the latency of stream playback.
